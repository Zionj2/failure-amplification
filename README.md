Failure Amplification

Failure Amplification is a focused explanatory project that examines how small failures can cascade into disproportionately large outcomes within systems.

Rather than treating failure as a single event, this project frames failure as a process: minor issues interact, compound, and propagate until the system can’t recover in time.

What This Is

- One core concept: failure amplification
- One concrete scenario illustrating the concept
- A simple static site designed for direct reading

Structure

- `index.html` — concept and principles
- `scenario.html` — the concrete cascade walkthrough
- `style.css` — readable styling

 Deployment

Hosted via GitHub Pages and updated automatically when changes are pushed.
