        <p class="hero-lede">
          In many systems, the disaster isn’t a single catastrophic event. It’s a
          chain reaction: minor issues interact, spread, and compound until the
          system can’t recover in time.

          <h3>Working definition</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Failure amplification</strong> is the process where
            <em>initially manageable</em> problems grow in impact because of
            <strong>feedback loops</strong>, <strong>hidden coupling</strong>,
            and <strong>delayed detection</strong>.

          <h3>Why it’s easy to miss</h3>
          <p>
            Small failures often look harmless in isolation. The risk lives in
            the <em>interaction</em> between failures: one workaround creates
            pressure elsewhere, which creates another workaround, and so on.

          <h3>What this project does</h3>
          <p>
            It keeps scope narrow: one core idea, one concrete example, and a
            readable format. The aim is to make the pattern visible, not to
            overwhelm you with theory.

          <h3>What you should gain</h3>
          <p>
            A better instinct for when “minor” issues are actually early signals
            of cascading failure — and what conditions make cascades more likely.

            <h3>1) Delay hides damage</h3>
            <p>
              If consequences arrive late, you keep doing the thing that caused
              them. By the time the signal appears, the system has already
              accumulated debt.
            </p>

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>2) Coupling spreads impact</h3>
            <p>
              Tightly connected parts share failure. One component running “a
              little hot” becomes everyone’s problem when there’s no slack.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>3) Workarounds create new risk</h3>
            <p>
              A workaround can be rational in the moment — but it often moves
              risk to a place you’re not watching, and makes the next failure
              more likely.
            </p>

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>4) Feedback loops accelerate</h3>
            <p>
              Once pressure creates behaviors that increase pressure, the system
              enters a loop. Loops are where “small” becomes “unstoppable.”
